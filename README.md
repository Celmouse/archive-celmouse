# Slide Control with Flutter and NodeJS via WebSocket

This project allows you to control a **Slideshow** (or any other software) remotely by simulating **mouse** and **keyboard** movements through a Flutter application connected via **WebSocket** to a NodeJS server. The Flutter app uses the device's **accelerometer** and **gyroscope** sensors to detect movements, providing a smooth experience for navigating slides or performing actions remotely.

## Features

- Remote control of slide presentations.
- Simulation of mouse movements and keyboard actions.
- Real-time connection between **NodeJS** and the **Flutter** app via **WebSocket**.
- Use of **accelerometer** and **gyroscope** sensors to detect movements.
- Ideal for those who need to control presentations while away from the device.
